Path Lockdown module by David Semeria
=====================================


DESCRIPTION
Path Lockdown generates a full list of all paths present on a Drupal site, and shows whether a given user can access them or not.

Paths are broken down into two main categories: system and site.
System paths are those provided by Drupal core and any third-party modules.
Site paths are those which are not system paths.
If you set-up your settings.inc file correctly, only your site-specific paths will be appear under 'site'.

QUICK START
Create a folder in sites/all/modules and put the Path Lockdown files in it.
Enable the Path Lockdown module. It appears under 'Development' in the module list.
Choose any url on your site and append this exact query: ?ld=pwd (you can change this later)
The query string should disappear from the browser address bar, and you should get a message saying Path Lockdown is enabled
Now type in the following url: yoursite.com/ld
You should see a page containing the full Path Lockdown output for the current user.
You can switch users (for example using the devel module) and the page will refresh.
There is no need to re-enable the module for each user.
To turn-off the module just append the following query: ?ld
Path Lockdown uses a session cookie for access control, and so closing your browser will also cause it to be disabled.  

UID MODE
Instead of logging in/out as a specific user, you can also pass Lockdown a user id (uid)
With Path Lockdown enabled, type in the url: yoursite.com/ld/uid (where uid = the user id you want to verify).
The module makes sure the uid is valid before processing, so don't worry about typos.

CUSTOMIZATION
For security purposes you can change the activation query (?ld=..), the activation password, and the path used by Path Lockdown (yoursite.com/ld). 
See default_settings.inc for details.

Since no two Drupal installations are identical, you will almost certainly have to add to the system paths in your settings.inc.
See default_settings.inc for details. 

You can also change the output format by specifying your own HTML tags.
